*** Black
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_gray#Black
      - "color of objects that do not emit or reflect light in any
        part of the visible spectrum; they absorb all such frequencies
        of light. "
      - "platonic ideal black is never found with actual pigments or
        other coloring, sufficiently dark items are generally referred
        to as "black".

********  aspatial (transcendent to space)
********  atemporal (transcendent to time)
	 - " atemporal means that it does not exist within any time
           period, rather it provides the formal basis for time."
*** increments
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incrementalism
    - "a method of working by adding to a project using many small
      incremental changes instead of a few (extensively planned) large
      jumps. Logical incrementalism implies that the steps in the
      process are sensible"
      - https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sensible
	- "sound judgment"
***** Grey
****** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey
      - "grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing
        to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor
        cold, neither material or spiritual. With grey, nothing seems
        to be decided."
	- "it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age."
******* increments
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment
     - "Incrementalism, a theory (also used in politics as a synonym for gradualism)"
       - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradualism
	 - "Gradualism, from the Latin gradus ("step")"
	 - "s a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change
           comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in
           nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps."
*********** Color Scales
************ Spots
************* depth ~ reflections ~ signs
*** Structurals
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration
    - "is the production of colour by microscopically structured
      surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes
      in combination with pigments"
      - color
***** Structure not pigment
****** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration#Structure_not_pigment
      - Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather
        than by pigments
******* Color Scales
******** Spots
********* class ~ effect ~ shades
******* Variable structures
******** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration#Variable_structures
********* increments
	 - "contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the
           layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is
           reflected"
	   - color
************* strokes
************** increments ~ changes ~ equilibriums
*** aspatials
**** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aspatial
    - "Not spatial"
      - https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spatial
	- "Pertaining to (the dimension of) space."
*** atemporals
**** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atemporal
    - "atemporal (unaffected by time)"
*** equilibriums
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium
    - "the condition of a system in which all competing influences are balanced"

or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that
variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in
large steps."
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradualism#Politics_and_society

       than in abrupt strokes"

      - "the notion" "relationship" "grow in the virtues gradually, and
        do not jump to perfection in a single step."
      - ""it is often better to encourage the positive elements""
        ""rather than to chastise their flaws""
