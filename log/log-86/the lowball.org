Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

  of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
  condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
  human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
