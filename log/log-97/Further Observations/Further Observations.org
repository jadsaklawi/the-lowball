* Open Problems
  - Number of waves emitted per burst.
  - How much sound can a single sound wave carry.[fn:1]
  - Direction of waves emitted from a burst.[fn:2]
* Hypotheses
  - Waves are carriers of information, an identifier.
    + Waves emitted by the same burst carry the same identifier.
* Further Observations
 - Given a wave burst emitted on a multi-polar antenna, wave is read
   by pole closest to burst.[fn:4]
 - Sound drops sound.[fn:5]
 - The auditory system in biological organisms is a sound antenna.

* Footnotes

[fn:5] For other kinds it is: waves drop waves, of the same type and at same frequency.

[fn:4] Experimentation required for the case of equally
distant poles.

[fn:2] For example emitted in a beam, spherical, random, etc..

[fn:1] Abstracts to: how much load can a single wave carry.
