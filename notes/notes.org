** Open Problems, Hypotheses, and Further Observations            :log:notes:
   [2022-05-14 Sat 08:50]
*** Open Problems
    - Number of waves emitted per burst.
    - How much sound can a single sound wave carry.
    - Direction of waves emitted from a burst.
*** Hypotheses
    - Waves are carriers of information, an identifier.
      + Waves emitted by the same burst carry the same identifier.
*** Further Observations
   - Given a wave burst emitted on a multi-polar antenna, wave is read
     by pole closest to burst.
   - Sound drops sound.
   - The auditory system in biological organisms is a sound antenna.

not getting news feed from, and the list news feed shows no entries

     Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer
        Page 163
**** notes
***** contents
Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

**** There is no spotter in standard Stratego.
**** If your spotter incorrectly guesses the flag, then the spotter
        is revealed to your enemy, the enemy’s flag is revealed to you, and
        both of them remain in play as normal.
**** You’d simply keep playing after this.
**** Of course, you now know exactly where the enemy’s flag is, and your spotter is right next to it:

  Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
  shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
  steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
  effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
  of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
  condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
  human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
  circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
  brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
  swirled before our eyes.
