     [2021-12-19 Sun]
Hello,

Many times before, I've heard you're name, but never gotten the chance to
see more of you or your art, not until very recently.
Subtle, sultry, luscious.

For this Christmas, from you, I'd like to ask that you gift me
yourself.

Jad

Find below very crude thoughts on curation of my first encounter with
Myriam:
 - We meet in a select location of her choice, I have in mind
   somewhere public, but with little to no people.
 - She arrives on foot, pauses at a distance of 10 to 15 meters from
   where I am waiting for her.
   * My choice of attire is an unbuttoned plaid shirt; colors pink,
     grey, white, with a few other shades. Shirt is on top of a white
     base layer t-shirt. (pictures to follow)
   * She can start moving forward towards me at her own time.
 - Upon arrival to a talking distance from me, I see the following
   happening:
   * First I'd like to introduce myself, something like: "Hello,
     this is Jad."
   * Myriam tells me something with the following semantics: You
     asked for it, for this Christmas, from me, I would like to gift
     you myself.
     - Of course, in Arabic first (Lebanese dialect), then in
       English, French, and any other languages Myriam is versed
       with. (Please let me know number of languages she will be
       reiterating in)
 - I'll be all by myself, however, I am assuming that all the
   recordings (video, pictures, etc..) of our first encounter are
   also provided to me. Everything--raw and unedited.
   + Please, as hard as it might be, all previous exchanges between me
     and Myriam and first encounter are not for consumption by any one
     (friends, colleagues, fans, public, etc...). Strictly top secret.
     * We can work out a version for sharing when the need arises.

** "bring it in" –
*** is a type of forced bet that occurs after the cards are initially dealt, but before any other action.
*** One player, usually chosen by the value of cards dealt face up
      on the initial deal, is forced to open the betting by some small
      amount, after which players act after them in normal rotation.
*** some spread-limit games, the bring-in amount is less
*** the bring-in is equal to the fixed bet (this is rare and not
     recommended), the game must either allow the bring-in player to

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Many times before, I've heard you're name, but never gotten the chance to

Subtle, sultry, luscious.

For this Christmas, from you, I'd like to ask that you gift me
yourself.

Hello,

Many times before, I've heard you're name, but never gotten the chance to
see more of you or your art, not until very recently.
Subtle, sultry, luscious.

For this Christmas, from you, I'd like to ask that you gift me
yourself.

Jad

Find below very crude thoughts on curation of my first encounter with
Myriam:
 - We meet in a select location of her choice, I have in mind
   somewhere public, but with little to no people.
 - She arrives on foot, pauses at a distance of 10 to 15 meters from
   where I am waiting for her.
   * My choice of attire is an unbuttoned plaid shirt; colors pink,
     grey, white, with a few other shades. Shirt is on top of a white
     base layer t-shirt. (pictures to follow)
   * She can start moving forward towards me at her own time.
 - Upon arrival to a talking distance from me, I see the following
   happening:
   * First I'd like to introduce myself, something like: "Hello,
     this is Jad."
   * Myriam tells me something with the following semantics: You
     asked for it, for this Christmas, from me, I would like to gift
     you myself.
     - Of course, in Arabic first (Lebanese dialect), then in
       English, French, and any other languages Myriam is versed
       with. (Please let me know number of languages she will be
       reiterating in)
 - I'll be all by myself, however, I am assuming that all the
   recordings (video, pictures, etc..) of our first encounter are
   also provided to me. Everything--raw and unedited.
   + Please, as hard as it might be, all previous exchanges between me
     and Myriam and first encounter are not for consumption by any one
     (friends, colleagues, fans, public, etc...). Strictly top secret.
     * We can work out a version for sharing when the need arises.

Subtle, sultry, luscious.

For this Christmas, from you, I'd like to ask that you gift me
yourself.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

   In addition to the swinging gait and sound pulsing there is what I refer
to as *action paralyses*, an attack with the aim of blocking anyone from
contacting or responding to me and prevent giving/signing orders that lead
to an arrival.
  At the time of writing I do not have any remedy against attack, however,
I do advise those affected to keep on trying, at least once per hour.

Hello,

Many times before, I've heard you're name, but never gotten the chance to
see more of you or your art, not until very recently.
Subtle, sultry, luscious.

For this Christmas, from you, I'd like to ask that you gift me
yourself.

Jad

Find below very crude thoughts on curation of my first encounter with
Myriam:
 - We meet in a select location of her choice, I have in mind
   somewhere public, but with little to no people.
 - She arrives on foot, pauses at a distance of 10 to 15 meters from
   where I am waiting for her.
   * My choice of attire is an unbuttoned plaid shirt; colors pink,
     grey, white, with a few other shades. Shirt is on top of a white
     base layer t-shirt. (pictures to follow)
   * She can start moving forward towards me at her own time.
 - Upon arrival to a talking distance from me, I see the following
   happening:
   * First I'd like to introduce myself, something like: "Hello,
     this is Jad."
   * Myriam tells me something with the following semantics: You
     asked for it, for this Christmas, from me, I would like to gift
     you myself.
     - Of course, in Arabic first (Lebanese dialect), then in
       English, French, and any other languages Myriam is versed
       with. (Please let me know number of languages she will be
       reiterating in)
 - I'll be all by myself, however, I am assuming that all the
   recordings (video, pictures, etc..) of our first encounter are
   also provided to me. Everything--raw and unedited.
   + Please, as hard as it might be, all previous exchanges between me
     and Myriam and first encounter are not for consumption by any one
     (friends, colleagues, fans, public, etc...). Strictly top secret.
     * We can work out a version for sharing when the need arises.

For at least the last two years, my Facebook news feed has been
completely omitting news from some friends, not showing a single post
from them. I tried creating a list with some of the friends whom I am
not getting news feed from, and the list news feed shows no entries
although there is activity in their respective profiles.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.

Nothing can remain immense if it can be measured. Prior to the
shrinkage of space and the abolition of distance through railroads,
steamships, and airplanes, there is the infinitely greater and more
effective shrinkage which comes about through the sruveying capacity
of the human mind, whose use of numbers, symbols, and models can
condense and scale earthly phsysical distance down to the size of the
human body's natural sense and understanding. Before we knew how to
circumscribe the sphere of human habitation in days and hours, we had
brought the globe into our living rooms to be touched by our hands and
swirled before our eyes.
